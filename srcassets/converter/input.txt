[0] That would be right, miss…?
[1] Avoid the question,

[if0]
[character=Baggy]
That would be right. I fear we haven't been presented yet, miss…?

[character=noir_emma]
You know my name is Emma. You literally spoke to me this morning.

[thinking=true]
Emma. I wonder why my memory is failing me today.
Might be the discount whisky from the corner pub.

[if1]
[character=Baggy]
Sorry ma'am, I'm simply heading to my room.

[character=noir_emma]
Don't play dumb, I heard you talking to that bitch in the backstage.
And don't call me ma'am, that's creepy as fuck. I'm Emma.

[thinking=true]
Emma. Quite a crass feline, if i'm to say.

[character=noir_emma]
Anyway, I'm coming with you. Gotta check on her.

[character=Baggy]
Very well, you may accompany me.

[thinking=true]
The doors open, and a few furs come out from inside the lift. When it empties, it is only me and the panther.
I press the button for the 24th floor, and the doors close.
The journey is silent.
She stares at the door, unflinching.
I don't attempt to start any conversation, either.
We arrived on floor 24. Stepping out, she walks behind me, keeping a good distance.
For a busy event, it is weird to see a hotel floor be this empty.
We stand in front of room 2418, at the end of the hallway. Emma is right behind, leaning on the wall.
I raise my hand, and my knuckles gently knock on the door. There's no answer. 
I knock again, a little harder. Still, no answer.

[character=Baggy]
Miss Beary? Are you in there?

[thinking=true]
Only silence.

[character=noir_emma]
Try the door handle.

[character=baggy]
There's no way it is open.

[thinking=true]
I grab the handle anyway, to show the foolishness of her suggestion.
…
It opens.

[character=noir_emma]
See? Go right ahead.

[thinking=true]
I groan, but I have to admit when I'm defeated.
I step inside the room, with no one in sight.
The bedsheets are unturned, and the luggage strewn across the floor tells me someone has been here, at least.
Some personal belongings, however, makes me think she's still in the room. The bathroom, perhaps?

[character=Baggy]
Miss Beary? Sorry to intrude, I…

[thinking=true]
Behind me, I hear something being lifted from the floor.

[character=Baggy]
Miss Emma?

Before I can properly turn around, something bashes against the side of my head.
It sends me toppling to the ground, and my vision flares with the pain.
Desperately, I try to grab something to help me up. 
Before I can, however, my head is bashed again.
And the world goes dark.
….
To be Continued.

End of ACT 2.
